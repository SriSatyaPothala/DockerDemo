## BASIC PROFILE WEB APP TO DEMONSTRATE DOCKER AND DOCKER COMPOSE
  This is a simple web application built with **Node.js and Express** that displays basic details
  like name, batch and email.

I have containerized the app using **Docker**, and **Docker Compose** to manage the setup and deployment.


### FEATURES
- Simple express.js server
- Shows basic details on a web page
- Fully containerized
- Runs via Docker Compose

**NOTE:**
Since the app only needs to serve basic details and static content and doesn't rely on other services like a database, I choose it to keep it simple and use a single container inside docker-compose

## Getting Started
- Clone the Repo
- cd DockerDemo
